HARD PROBLEM

Given two strings, determine the dit distance between them.
The edit distance is defined as the minimum number of edits
(insertion, deletion or subtitution) needed to change on string
to the other.

For example, "biting" and "sitting" have an edit distance of 2
(substitute b for s, and insert a t).
'''


def distance(s1, s2):
    # Fill this in.


print(distance('bitting', 'sitting'))
# 2
